I wanted a website that has a timer ticking each page and doesn't reset. There will be recipe with pictures clickable links you to a website where you can find the varieties recipes. 

Had to scrap out the kitchen count down timer as I am not a 100% sure on how I was going to implement it. 

Having issues with footers where it doesn't completely stay at the bottom of the page. -> Update - Adjusted the footer to work and stay at the bottom of the page.

The trello I've drawned up are somewhat identical other and wasn't sure if you wanted photos on Figma but I have that in the doc folder and links here:
https://www.figma.com/file/81v3x1W3F6cRjWpDTYa4QS/

Other issues I am currently having is API issues. It showing "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')" Had asked James but I still dont understand why it doesn't show up on the quiz page but the other 4 does.

There are some codes that I have used from stackoverflow and also codepen. 

Licenses will be base on images from Unsplash. 
I have pictures from https://www.bradleysmoker.com/ but I couldn't find their license agreement. I will be reaching out to them for permission.
